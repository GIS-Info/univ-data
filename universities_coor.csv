Most of MGIST graduates went to the industry. The PhD program of Spatial Analytics is interdisciplinary. Its duration is 4 to 5 years. Students need to use GIS and other methods to complete a research project in the domains of physical or social sciences. Members of the dissertation committee come from different departments according to the research topic selected by the student. This program also requires an industrial internship in the first two years in order to better integrate the industry, education and research experiences in student’s future scientific career.

Professors in the center are all teaching-oriented faculty members responsible for the teaching and guidance of core courses like GIS. Doctoral students need to find their own scientific research interests and directions, and then find their own research advisors in any departments participating in the center’s project.

This program also has collaborative programs with other programs in the same department (e.g., resource geography, social geography, geomorphology, glaciology, etc.). There are two types of graduate programs: project-based (including MA, MSc and PhD degrees) and lecture-based (MGIS degrees). The subject-based degree requires participation in scientific research and completion of a thesis, during which time courses closely related to the research content are required. The taught degree MGIS does not require research participation, but requires more advanced courses related to geomatics and remote sensing with more comprehensive coverage, which also takes 2 years to complete.
